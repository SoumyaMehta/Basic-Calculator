# QCalc

The objective of this project is to obtain basic skills in Java and OOPs principles by building a subset of features seen in calculators.

During the course of this project, 

1. Made use of different features of VSCode IDE to build the project.
2. Built feature of a calculator by taking OOPS Principles into consideration.
3. Fixed the bugs in the implementation for newly introduced features of calculator.
